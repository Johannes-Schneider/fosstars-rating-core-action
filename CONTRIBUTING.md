We welcome ideas for improvements and pull requests.
This document describes how to submit them.

# Understand the basics

We encourage using forks and pull requests.
Please take a look at GitHub's excellent
[help documentation first](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

# Using GitHub issues

We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/SAP/fosstars-rating-core-action/issues)
to track bugs and enhancements.

Before you open a new issue, please do a bit of searching in our GitHub issues to see
if you can find something similar. If not, please create a new issue before submitting a pull request.

If you are reporting a bug, please provide as much information as possible.

# Discuss non-trivial contribution ideas with committers

If you're considering anything more than correcting a typo or fixing a minor bug,
please open an issue and discuss the proposal with us
before submitting a pull request.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)

Due to legal reasons, contributors will be asked to accept a DCO before they
submit the first pull request to this projects, this happens in an automated
fashion during the submission process. SAP uses
[the standard DCO text of the Linux Foundation](https://developercertificate.org/).

# Commit the changes

Choose the granularity of your commits consciously and squash commits
that represent multiple edits or corrections of the same logical change.
See the [Commit Guidelines section of Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project#Commit-Guidelines)
for best practices around commit messages, and use `git log` to see some examples.

*  Keep the subject line short if possible.
*  Please refer to the GitHub issue number in the description of the commit.
*  Please do not end the subject line with a period.

# Submit your pull request

*  Please explain the changes you introduce.
*  Please add any additional information.
