# Fosstars ratings

This action calculates [a security rating for an open source project](https://sap.github.io/fosstars-rating-core/oss_security_rating.html).
The rating shows how well the project cares about security.
It takes into account multiple factors:

*  How well the open source project implements security testing.
*  How well the projectâ€™s community is aware of best security practices and adopt them.
*  How well vulnerabilities are patched in the project.
*  How the community commits to supporting the project.
*  How active and popular the project is.

Fosstars uses only publicly available data about open source projects.

The action creates a detailed report that explains how the rating was calculated.
In addition, the report contains recommendations for improving the security rating.
The action also generates a badge with the calculated rating.
The report and the badge are stored in a specified branch.

## Inputs

### `report-branch`

**Required** A branch where the report and the badge should be stored. Default `fosstars`.

### `token`

**Required** A token for fetching data about the project via GitHub API,
and for committing the report and badge to the specified branch.

## How to use it

Here is an example workflow that updates the report every day, or when a commit is pushed.
The report is stored to the `fosstars-report` branch.

```
name: "Fosstars"
on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
  schedule:
    - cron: "0 0 * * *"

jobs:
  create_fosstars_report:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    name: "Security rating"
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.4
      - uses: ./.github/actions/fosstars-create-single-report
        with:
          report-branch: fosstars-report
          token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

The badge will be stored to the same branch. It can be used in a README file:
